#### Selflessness, Photosynthesis and Solar Energy

"... sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's gonna owe it one ..." 
    - Linkin Park (A Place For My Head)
- http://www.metrolyrics.com/a-place-for-my-head-lyrics-linkin-park.html

- Taking a leaf from the plants' books: photosynthesis for life sustenance
- Solar energy is the future of electricity and electricity is the power to drive this planet

- Powers a new God:
    - Electricity is a God of the now and the future
    - Sand (silica) converts the Solar energy to Electricity
    

#### Sunrises and Sunsets

- Transitions 
    - from the dark of the night into the day 
        - start of a something 
        - marks the beginning point of a steady (day-to-day) cycle
    - from the light of the day into the night 
        - end of something 
        - marks the end of cycle in a steady cycle

- Beauty and Glory
    - sunrises and sunsets are glorious 
    - the break of dawn symbolizes hopes, ambition and drive
    - sunsets mark the beautiful and contented completion of the hustle and bustle of the day
