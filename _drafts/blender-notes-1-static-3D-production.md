# modelling

### quads and flow integrity 

- flow of elements of the surface is crucial for model surface integrity

- to preserve flow integrity in surface elements, 
    - all elements have to be quads i.e. have exactly 4 vertices

- if flow isn't preserved
    - loop cuts will fail 
    - subsurface modifier will garble the surface

# texturing

- texturing is all about understanding the imperfections of the real world and emulating it in the 3D render
