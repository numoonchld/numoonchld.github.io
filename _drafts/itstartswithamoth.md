## 0/ it starts with a moth

## 1/ sleep, food and water are important for your health 

## 2/ honesty is the best policy<sup>*</sup>

## 3/ you will teach yourself to not kill yourself with your own sword

there is no entitlement to sanity

## 4/ if you can't say the write thing, it is hard to do the write thing

## 5/ no blaming, only observation

## 6/ who the f*** (pop) wrote this game

the edge of the knife is an ocean

## 7/ things will fall in place if trust the <u>heart of card</u>

## 8/ Thing: Discrete packets in synapse

## \# does not compute 

## \# packets and granite

## \# does not compute {}â€¢

## 9/ Give and you shall receive *muffled angry nigger noises*



## 10/ Things are exactly what they appear to be (most of the time)

## 11/ Don't think (and drive)

## 12/ 2 euros and some ash from the tree of life
