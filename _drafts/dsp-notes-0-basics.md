## digital signal processing 

- signal: description of a physical phenomenon's evolution over time

- signal processing:
    - analysis: understanding the information carried by the signal
    - synthesis: creating a signal to contain the given information 

- digital paradigm for signal processing:
    - discrete digitized time
    - discrete digitized amplitude

- each 'sample' is subjected to both:
    - time discretization: time component 'n'
    - amplitude discretization: amplitude component 'x'

- a sample is denoted by \\( x[n] \\)

#### discrete-time

- discrete-time model: 
    - more practical model of reality
    - a paradigm that moves away from the idealistic analog paradigm
        - makes computation more intuitive 
        - finding solutions are easier with computational methods

- Sampling Theorem:
    - mathematically, analog and discrete models are equivalent
        - provided sufficient sampling is available for discrete models

- samples replace idealized models
- simple math replaces calculus


#### discrete-amplitude

- each amplitude can only take on a value from a predetermined set
    - the number of levels in countable
    - so the amplitude is mapped to a set of integers

- this ability to integer mapping provides benefits for
    - storage
    - processing
    - transmission

- analog signals suffer from noise and attenuation in way that causes loss of information during signal transmission
    - digital signal transmission mechanisms are more robust 
    - information is significantly low

- general-purpose storage can be used
- general-purpose processing can be applied
- noise can be controlled during signal transmission

## discrete-time signals

- 'lollipop' notation
- discrete-time signals sampled sufficiently densely look continuous in a plot

#### formally

- a sequence of complex numbers
- one dimensional
- notation: \\( x[n] \\)
    - \\( [n] \\): integer
- two-sided sequences: \\( x: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{C} \\) 
    - \\( n \in (-\infty,+\infty)   \\) 
- n is *adimensional* "time"
    - no physical units, just sets a numerical id to the sample 
- analysis eg.: periodic temperature 
    - synthesis for this: stream of generates samples

#### fundamental discrete signals

- delta signal: \\( x[n] = ùõø[n] \\)  
    - when \\(n = 0 , x = 1 \\); else \\(x = 0\\)
    - signifies a physical phenomenon that lasts a very short duration of time
    - eg. a clapper for syncing video and audio for a movie recording 
        - when audio and video recording happens separately

- unit step: \\( x[n] = u[n] \\)
    - when \\( n < 0, x = 0 \\); else \\(x = 1 \\)
    - synonymous to flipping a switch

{: style="font-size: 80%; text-align: center;"}

- exponential decay: \\( x[n] = \lvert a\rvert^n u[n], \lvert a\rvert < 1 \\)
    - when \\( n < 0, x = 0 \\); else \\(x\\) decays exponentially, starting from \\( 1 \\) @ \\( n = 0 \\)
    - \\( x \rightarrow 0 \\) as \\( n \rightarrow \infty \\)
    - newton's law of cooling
        - cooling of a coffee cup
    - rate of capacitor discharge

- sinosoid: \\( x[n] = sin(\omega_0n + \theta) \\)
    - \\( \omega_0 \\): angular frequency (rad)
    - \\( \theta \\): initial phase (rad)

## signal classes

- finite-length
- infinite length
- periodic 
- finite-support

#### finite-length signals

- can only have \\(N\\) samples 
    - \\(N\\): range of signal
    - \\(N\\) is limited in finite-length signals
- notations: 
    - sequence: \\(x[n], n = 0,1,\ldots,N-1\\)
    - vector: \\(x = [x_0, x_1,\ldots, x_{N-1} ]^T \\)
- practical entities
    - good for numerical packages 

#### infinite-length signals

- can have infinite number of samples
- it is an abstraction
- useful for theorems that do not depend on the length of the data

#### periodic signals

- repetitive samples with a constant frequency 

- notation: \\(\tilde{x}\\)
- \\(N\\)-periodic signals: \\( x[n] = \tilde{x}[n + kN]; n, k, N \in \mathbb{Z} \\)
    - data repeats every \\(N\\) samples
    - same information as finite-length of length \\(N\\)
    - natural bridge between finite and infinite lengths

#### finite-support signals

- infinite length sequence
    - but only a finite number of non-zero sample

- notation: \\(\bar{x}\\)
- \\( \bar{x}  = x[n] \\) if \\(0 \leq n \leq N \\) else \\( x = 0 ; n \in \mathbb{Z} \\)
- same information as finite-length 
- another bridge between finite and infinite length lengths

## elementary signal operations

- scaling:
    - \\( y[n] = \alpha\cdot x[n] \\)
- sum:
    - \\( y[n] = x[n] + z[n] \\)
- product:
    - \\( y[n] = x[n]\cdot z[n] \\)
- delay (shift):
    - \\( y[n] = x[n-k], x \in \mathbb{Z} \\)
    - output of operation is shifted by k samples
    - care must be taken to append and prepend zeros to accommodate the shift 

    - two types of delay:
        - finite-length is turned into finite-support 
            - by adding zeros until \\( -\infty \\) and \\( +\infty \\) 
            - then shift is applied
        - make the finite-signal periodic:  
            - samples circle around in the given range of \\(N\\)

- energy:
    - sum of the squares of all amplitudes of the signal 
    - consistent with physical energy 
    - many signals have infinite energy i.e. periodic signals
    - so not a great way to describe the energetic property of a signal 


\\[ E_x = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \lvert x[n] \rvert^2 \\]

- power: 
    - a singal cannot have infinte power even if it's energy is infinite
    - power is the rate of production of energy for a sequence
    - it is limit of the ratio of local energy in a window to the size of the window as N goes to infinity
    - for a periodic signal, the power is the ratio fo energy in one period to the length of the period

\\[ P_x = \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{2N+1} \sum_{n=-N}^{N} \lvert x[n] \rvert^2 \\]
