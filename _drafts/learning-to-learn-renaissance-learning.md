1. physical exercise is the best gift to the brain
    - in a few places of the brain, new neurons are born everyday
    - hippocampus
        - important area for learning new things
        - new neurons help in improved pattern recognition
        - they die if they are not used
        - exercise helps the new neurons survive
            - better than any drugs on the market
        - also benefits all body organs

2. practice makes permanent 
    - only when the brain is prepared 
    - critical period of learning specific skills
    - first language acquisition - extends up to puberty
    - past the critical period, process takes much longer 

3. the prefrontal cortex separates humans and zombies
    - patients turn into zombies when their prefrontal cortex is damaged
    - there is a certain amount of zombie is humans until the pre-frontal cortex is fully developed
    - although IQ can still be high, 
        - bad financial decisions and
        - bad social decisions happen through a damaged pre frontal cortex
    - good judgement takes experience with learning to acquire
    - as a result learning is too important to be left behind in the classroom
    - learning to learn may be applied for improved learning in all parts of life

***

- when learning new things, things that made sense before might make no sense
- restructuring to existing learning occurs when learning new things
    - there may be temporary periods of frustration due to restructuring existing understanding with the new materials learnt
    - a good night's sleep and spaced repetition usually fixes this

- visual metaphors and analogies to understand new concepts
    - they can be made more sophisticated as the concept is learned more deeply 
    - they help glue new ideas into the mind as they link new concepts to existing patterns

- impostor syndrome 
    - stems from genius envy
    - chunking and interleaving along with spaced repetition helps learn a new skill
    - once a pattern has been understood and memorized
        - there is no need to explain it over and over again to yourself
    - if someone is forcing you to do this beyond a certain point
        - they are trying to scam you
        - sometimes it is a honest attempt at recollecting a concept
        - but be wary, this quickly turns into malice

- be aware of where einstellung is blocking you from learning new concepts
    - it hard to identify old zombies
    - using a smaller working memory helps 
    - as other ideas can come in more
    - it helps to write down existing thoughts to clear up working memory

- keep your chin up and eye on the open door
    - it takes time to find the open door with existing zombies crowding mental space

#### social response to learning

- there will always be a set of people dedicated to criticize or attempt to undermine your learning 
    - keep in mind that those who are dedicated to self development will not have the time to do this
    - this happens to everyone including nobel prize winners
    - like how in school, people are threatened by you when you do well 
        - focus on the phenomenon of insecurity that is caused by your actions
        - only in people who choose to be threatened instead of being inspired
- the greater your achievement, the more people attack
    - there will also be attempt to demean you and shame you for other aspects
    - anything to bring you down 
        - look up crab mentality
    - they will even paint it as looking out for you and 'testing' you
        - to stay in your good books 
    - essentially jealously has a myriad of forms
- this gets amplified when you are learning something new and fail at an attempt
    - a lot of people throw barbs are criticize you for your failures 
    - when they would be watching silently without cheering you when you succeed 
    - they are stuck in lower levels of consciousness 
    - simple stick to your path, keeping in mind that they do not offer value to your learning and growth as a human being 
        - and they actively sabotage their own learning when they throw barbs at other's growth

- there is a statement that says empathy is universally beneficial 
    - this is false propaganda 
    - benefits only the people who want to stay stuck in their ways and throw barbs in other's growth
    - a healthy disconnect from empathy for such people is a requirement for growth 
        - no need for malice to these people
        - but there needs to be a healthy disregard for them, considering how they bring no value to the table of growth and learning 

- it is normal to believe that everyone believes in the cause of self growth and learning
    - it is is easy to believe that everyone is good hearted towards us
    - in the real world, people are assholes
        - sometimes just to prove that other people can be assholes 
        - and claim to be 'teaching' you about the real world
    - work achieved inspite of such deterrents leads to a sense of pride 
        - prejudices from others do not add value to your world
        - disconnect and tarry on self development
