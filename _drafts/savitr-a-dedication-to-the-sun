The moon's gonna owe it one ..."

    - we all come from water and go back to water
    - the source of organisms on this planet
    - the majority of the human body is water
    - There is life in water due to inherent polarity on water: H+ and OH- ions
    - Life is polar: opposites exist, sometimes in conflict, other times in harmony and everywhere in between

- watches all and everything, everything that happens in the day happens in under light of the sun

###### Savitr

###### Aruna
