- a long time ago, but not too long ago, but quite long ago, there lived a fakir outside a village

- a wild watermelon patch had cropped up outside the village
- the villagers,, who had never seen a watermelon before, happened across the watermelon patch 
- they grew fearful of the waterlmelons and threw stones at it

- the fakir, who knew what a watermelon was, decided to resolve their confusion

- while the villagers were throwing stones at the watermelon patch, the fakir approched them and stopped them 
- he advised the villagers to stop throwing stones and observe the patch instead for a week 
  - the villagers noticed that watermelons had done nothing 
- the fakir then told them to observe the watermelons from a closer distance for the next week 
  - the villagers again saw that the watermelons did nothing 
- this continued untill the villagers were right next to the watermelon
  - that day, the fakir brought a knife long with him
- he touched the watermelon and demonstrated to the villagers that the watermelon was harmless
- he pulled a watermelon out from the patch
  - gave it the ripeness test with his fingers and cut open the watermelon with his knife
