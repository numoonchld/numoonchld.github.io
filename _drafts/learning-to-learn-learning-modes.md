- doctors are told at the beginning of their degree that half the things they learn during their degree will be moot by the time they graduate 
  - so there is something to be said about constant learning 
  - and something to be said about the hyprocrite's oath 
- following is some pop-culture basics of learning

***

## learning modes 

- in line with how the brain works according to the brain's working 
  - two fundamentally different modes of learning 
    - focussed mode 
    - diffused mode 
    
- both metaphor and analogy are useful when learning something new
- cannot be in both thinking modes at the same time
  - like a coin, cannot see both side of a coin at the same time

#### focussed mode

- this is like a pinball machine with densely spaced bumpers 
- thoughts are like the ball in the machine
- patterns are how the pinball maves in between the bumpers 
- there are only so many patterns possible 
- relies on diffuse thinking mode to get new patterns
  - SNR of new patterns is subtle until it fully sets in
- zombie like thinking 
- cast light strongly in one path, while leaving the rest dark
- the pinball cant go very far, but useful for step-by-step problem solving 

#### diffused mode

- this is like a pinball machine with sparsely spaced bumpers 
- diffused thinking mode is a broad, big picture process
- necessary for understandng something hasnt been understood before
- necessary for finding solutions for problems that have not been faced before
- brings in new thought patterns into the metaphorical pinball frame
- does not cost light in one region strongly, but lights up all areas diffusely

## using the modes

- brain has amazing ablities, but no instruction manual
- a lot of crazy dead people (Thomas Edison, Salvodor Dali) used to almost fall asleep and harras themselves into waking up using tricks
  - to force the diffuse thinking and then gather the new thoughts in their waking state
  
- similar to body-building, a little neural work in diffused and focussed thinking has to be done everyday under a regiment to strengthen the two systems
  - constant effort is the T R I C K
  
- learning something difficult takes takes time, and more so for people conditioned with only one type of thinking 

#### learning 

- the brain is allegedly useful to learn new things
- it supposedly consumes three time more energy per unit weigth compared to the rest of the body
  - thoughts, hopes and fears are allegedly in the neurons of the brain
- chess and math are supposedly prized abilities of the brain
  - reading being able to screw fellow humans 
  - and keep tabs on fellow humans 
- most of the heavy lifting is done under the hood, in the subsconscious
  - it is not necessary to know how this works to survive
- different parts of the brain are active during interaction with the world and when resting
  - the parts dedicated to interacting with the world turn off when resting and vice-versa
- brain connections are dynamic, even after it matures
- new synapses are formed and other disappear
  - memory is still stable after many years
- new synapses are formed on a dendrite after a learning and rest cycle
- synapses are less than a micron in diameter
  - human hair is 10 microns in diameter
- so, technically, a brain wakes up with an upgrade when it wakes up
  - insomnia affects learning and problem solving skills

#### procrasination 

- arises from the fact that you can be working only on one thing at a time
- if one thing is being worked on, other things are not being worked on

- when a activity that is not desirable to do is considered, the pain centers (insular cortex) in the brain are activated
- the brain is designed to look for paths to avoid that negative experience
  - however, for some activities, the pain centers get activated less when the brain learns to do the activity better
  
  
###### procrastination and pomodoro

- pomodoro is italian for learning
- it is allegedly a technique of using a timer 
  - 25 minutes of uninterrupted work
  - then a reward at the end of the 25 minutes for focussing
    - may include a cup of coffee, bite of chocolate, sex, strecthing, mindless chatting etc
- the goal is to rest the focussed thinking mode and turn on the resitng mode 
  - key is there should be no focussed activity after that 25 minutes
  


###### practice makes permanent

- neural thought patterns are real physical objects 
- they are weak when a new thing is being learnt 
- practise makes these patterns strong i.e. permanent
- a little eveyrday helps build a strong foundation while learning something new 
- all at one causes the learning system to fail and associate negative thoughts to the idea of learning and the thing being learnt
- this strengthens procrastination
- so pomodoro technique is usedto avoid too much at once to prevent learning overload


#### memory

- spaced repetetion helps settle in new concepts stronger
- while learning something new, repeating it 20 times spread across 20 days is better than 20 times in a single day 

- on the same lines pomodoro is done in cycles of 30 minutes, with 5 minutes of break between each 25 minute block


#### sleep

- the wake state creates neuro toxins in the brain
- during sleep, neurons shrink and the brain fluid washes the toxins out 
- sleep helps brain clean up toxins, so it is an essential part of brian maintainence
- lack of sleep increases toxicity in the brain and prvents it from functioning correctly
  - sacrificing sleep is like shooting one self in the foot
- too little sleep for a long period of time causes headaches, depression, heart diseases, diabetes and causes earlier death
- during sleep the brain rehearses some of the tougher parts of whatever is being learnt 
  - the temporary deactivation of the prefrontal cortex during sleep helps the other parts of the brain talk easily to one other
  - this helps them put together solutions to new taks begin learned
  - dreaming allegedly consolidates memories into easier to grasp chunks
  
- execrise also is allegedly supposed to improve learning and memory capabilities
