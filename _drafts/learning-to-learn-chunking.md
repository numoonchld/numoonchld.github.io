## chunking

- a chunk is like creating a zip file of many ideas
  - like stitching together a word from letters
  
- a chunk is a piece of information neurologically speaking 
  - a symphony of neurons firing together
  - to think a thought or do an action
  
- focussed mode learning helps start forming chunks 
  - but stress, anger and fear block this 
  
#### forming chunks

- grasping small patterns of the big picture 
- then graudaully knitting them together 
- when done with proper learning technqiues, leads to the ability of doing it without applying much thought

- chunking for every topic is a bit different
- however, the underlying mental scheme is the same
  - get the main idea first 
  - then break it into as many pieces as possible
- seeing the problem being solved helps provife the big picture

- just because the problem solving process was observed, expertise isnt implied 
  - aha != expertise
- many things are understood only after it is done without looking at the sample provided
  - like seeing a painting or listening to a song desnt mean you can create it

- there are three elements in the scheme of chunking
  - big picture
  - context
  - chunks
  
- top down process: big-picture and context linking 
- botton up process: chucnk and context linking
- mastery requires both these linkings to happen correctly
  - focussed attention
  - understanding with diffused leanring 
  - temporally spaced practise

## illusions of competence 

- typically re-doing the material learned is used to develop further understanding 
  - however, this is counter productive and inefficient
  - it is more useful to try to recall what was read the first time
    - without looking 
    - this is the recall technique 
    - to be used instead of re-doing method  
  - the recall process itself aids deeper learning 
    - helps forms better chunks for firing neurons

- the only time re-doing helps is when there more time between two iterations 
  - as this works as a spaced repetition
  - there needs to be a sleep and wake cycle between each iteration 
  
- sometimes taking notes and writing down material can fool the brain into thinking you've learnt the material 

- mnistakes are helpful to find out holes in understanding 
- mistakes can be corrected bit by bit to improve depth and quality of understanding 
  - and this is why tests exist

## ease of learning 

- it is harder to learn when there is no inderest in the topic
- it is easy to learn when motivated and interested in the topic
  - this is becasue the neurons in the cortex carry information about what is happening around you
  - and actions
- brain also has diffusely projecting systems of neuromodulators that carry information 
  - these carry information about the value of the experience content 
  - not the content itself 

#### neuromodulators 

- includes (not limited to) acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin
- these have a profound impact on unconscious mind


###### acetylcholine

- these neurons form neuromodulatory connection to the cortex that are particulary important for focused learning when paying lcose attention
- project widely and activate circuits that control synaptic palsticity leading to new long term memory 

###### dopamine

- dopamine allegedly 'controls' motivation
  - they are a part of a large reward-learning system

- dopamine is found in small set of neurons in the mid-brain
  - partcularly in the basal ganglia just above the mid-brain 
  - below the cortex of the top brain
  
- dopamine signals project widely and have a powerful effect on learning 
  - they are released when we receive and unexpected reward
  - also affects decision-making and the value of the sensory inputs 

- dopamine is in the business of precdicting future rewards 
  - not just the immediate rewards
  - this can motivate you to do something right now that may be not a instataneously rewarding 
  - but may lead to a better reward in the future 
  
- addictive drugs artificially increase dopamine activity and fool brain into thinking that something wornderful has happened 
  - leads ot craving and dependence which can hijack free will 
  - and motivate harmful behavior
  
- loss of dopamine neurons leads to lack of motivation and 
  - something called "anhedoina" 
  - which is a loss of interest in things that once gave you pleasure
  
- severe loss of dopamine neurons causes resting tremors, slowness, rigidity, parkinson's disease 
  - ultimately leads to catatonia, a complete lack of any movement 

- dopamine neurons are part of the unconscious brain
- when using reward-promise in the pomodoro technique, it is essentially tapping into the dopamine mechanism 

###### serotonin

- diffuse neuromodulatory system that strongly affects social life 
- in monkey troops, the alpha male has the highest level of serotonin activity
- lowest ranking male has lowest ranking activity 
- prozac, which is the medication for clinical depression, 
  - increases serotonin activity
- serotonin is also closely related risk-taking behavior
  - higher risk in lower serotonin monkeys 
- jailed inmates have the lowest recorded levels of serotonin 


#### emotions 

- emotions strongly affect learning 
- emotions are entwined with perception, and attention span
- emotions interact with learning and memory 

- the amygdala is a part of the limbic system
  - along with the hippocampus, is involved in memory and decision-making 
  - regulating emotional reactions 
- the amygdala must be happy to be an effective learner

- emotions and neuromodulatory systems are slower than perception and action
  - but hold same importance in learning process

## value of chunk library

- historically, combining chunks in new and 'orignal' ways has given rise to innovation
- read about machine learning algorithms making discoveries that were hidden in old research literature, but not realized in reality
- people gradually build the number fo chunks in their brain to increase knowledge and gain 'expertise'
  - chunks are specifically valuable pieces of information 
  - that can be pieced together in new ways
  
- applies to musicians, linguists and scientists 
  - bigger and better the mental chunk library for the given field
    - easier it is to solve problems and figure out solutions 

###### transfer

- chunking helps understand new concepts
  - when one chunk is grasped, it can be linked to related chunks in surprising ways 
  - not only in that particular field, but different fields
  - this is called 'transfer'
  
- chunking is only one of the components of developing of creative flexibility in learning 

- a chunk is a way of expressing ideas more compactly
  - when organizing chunks, different types and concepts are identified 
  - this helps in grasping new things more easiliy 
  
#### sequential and intuitive (holistic) 

- chunks are useful for step-by-step organization during learning 
- and enable global intuitive access while retrieving memorized and understood information 

- most difficult problems and concepts are grasped through intuition 
- diffuse mode is an almost random way of making connections 
  - these need to be verified using the focussed mode while solidifying learning
  - intuitive insights aren't always correct
  
#### law of serendipity

- lady luck favors the one who tries
- the first piece of concept might be hard to grasp
  - but the secodn chunk goes in easier 
  - the third easier still
  
#### overlearing 

- practising over and over again during the same session
- a little repetetion is useful and necessary
- continued learning after mastering the content is called overlearning 
- it can produce automaticity in contexts of tennis and playing muscial insturments 
- it can be helpful for people not comfortable with public speaking, or when you choke on tests
- automaticity is helpful in times of nervousness
- however overlearning costs a lot in terms of learning time

###### illusion of competence

- overlearning leads ot illusion of competence 
- it also leads to the thinking that bashing in something will fix things and learning new things is just simply overlearning 
- these are slow strategies and drain motivation chemicals 
- hammering away at the same content in a study session doesnt strengthen the material learned 
  - it is important to include sleep cycles between repetetions 
- time can be wasted automaticizing the easy stuff and not even going simple mastery over the diffucult things
- there should be deliberate attempt to tackle difficult topics during learning 

#### einstellung

- means mindset in german

- a pattern already developed in your mind or a neural pattern you've already developed and strengthened may prevent a better idea or solution from being found 

- in the pinball machine paradigm of the brain, the thought patterns in the upper brain dominate, unyielding to the solutions to problems coming from the lower brain

- the crowded bumpers of focussed thinking and previous thought patterns can create a rut preventing looking in different places where the solution might be found

- this is the wrong approach but very easy to do, the initial thinking is misleading 
  - older patterns might need to unlearned before and while learning new patterns
  
#### sinking and interleaving

- getting into solving problems without priming the mind with relevant information is called sinking 

- for instance, not reading the text book, attending lectures and viewing online lessons before taking a test or doing work associated

- understanding how to obtian solutions is the part that is missed here

- mastering a new concept involves lerning new chunks AND knowing how to select and apply different chunks 

- the best way to learn this is to jump back and forth between situations that require strategies and techniques from different chunks 
  - this is called interleaving

- while laying down the foundations use the focussed method to initiate chunks in a linear, sequential fashion

- to strengthen and master a subject, use interleaving along with seperated repetitions 

- when mastering a subject, it is important to let the brain know that forming patterns for only one kind of concept, approach and problem-solving is not enough 

- it assissts in deeper understanding of a subject 

- practise and repetition builds strong neural patterns (chunks), interleaving builds flexibility and creativity 

- when chunks in the same subject are interleaved, it builds creativity in that subject

- when different subjects are interleaved, connections between different subjects are generated enabling more creativity 

- however, the chunks from different fields have to be solid enough for these patterns to be applicalble in real life

- some dead fucker who was apparently a philosopher allegedly said that paradigm shifts in science are brought about either by young people or people trained in other disciplines 
  - since they are not prone to einstllung to the degree that exisitng domain experts are
   - experts essentially are people trapped in the einstellung
  
- learning does not happen only from teachers and books, it also happens when 
  - you lay a bully to rest, 
  - you fix a a leaky faucet,
  - you pack a suitcase for a vacation

## chunking summary - chunking chunking 

- chunks are pieces of information, neuroscientifically speaking, 
  - bound together through use 
  - and through shared meaning 
  
- can be viewed as a scintillating network of neurons that compactly sysntehsize key ideas or actions 

- they can grow to get bigger 
- but they are meant to be a single easy access item that you can fit like a ribbon into the slot on your working memory 

- chunks are best built understanding the idea with focussed, undivided attention

- practise helps deepen patterns and gain the context bigger than chunks

- simple recall i.e. remembering the content without refering to the learning source after having learnt from it, is the best technique to form chunks
