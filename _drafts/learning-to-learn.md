- doctors are told at the beginning of their degree that half the things they learn during their degree will be moot by the time they graduate 
  - so there is something to be said about constant learning 
  - and something to be said about the hyprocrite's oath 
- following is some pop-culture basics of learning

***

## learning modes 

- in line with how the brain works according to the brain's working 
  - two fundamentally different modes of learning 
    - focussed mode 
    - diffused mode 
    
- both metaphor and analogy are useful when learning something new
- cannot be in both thinking modes at the same time
  - like a coin, cannot see both side of a coin at the same time

#### focussed mode

- this is like a pinball machine with densely spaced bumpers 
- thoughts are like the ball in the machine
- patterns are how the pinball maves in between the bumpers 
- there are only so many patterns possible 
- relies on diffuse thinking mode to get new patterns
  - SNR of new patterns is subtle until it fully sets in
- zombie like thinking 
- cast light strongly in one path, while leaving the rest dark
- the pinball cant go very far, but useful for step-by-step problem solving 

#### diffused mode

- this is like a pinball machine with sparsely spaced bumpers 
- diffused thinking mode is a broad, big picture process
- necessary for understandng something hasnt been understood before
- necessary for finding solutions for problems that have not been faced before
- brings in new thought patterns into the metaphorical pinball frame
- does not cost light in one region strongly, but lights up all areas diffusely

***

## using the modes

- brain has amazing ablities, but no instruction manual
- a lot of crazy dead people (Thomas Edison, Salvodor Dali) used to almost fall asleep and harras themselves into waking up using tricks
  - to force the diffuse thinking and then gather the new thoughts in their waking state
  
- similar to body-building, a little neural work in diffused and focussed thinking has to be done everyday under a regiment to strengthen the two systems
  - constant effort is the T R I C K
  
- learning something difficult takes takes time, and more so for people conditioned with only one type of thinking 

#### learning 

- the brain is allegedly useful to learn new things
- it supposedly consumes three time more energy per unit weigth compared to the rest of the body
  - thoughts, hopes and fears are allegedly in the neurons of the brain
- chess and math are supposedly prized abilities of the brain
  - reading being able to screw fellow humans 
  - and keep tabs on fellow humans 
- most of the heavy lifting is done under the hood, in the subsconscious
  - it is not necessary to know how this works to survive
- different parts of the brain are active during interaction with the world and when resting
  - the parts dedicated to interacting with the world turn off when resting and vice-versa
- brain connections are dynamic, even after it matures
- new synapses are formed and other disappear
  - memory is still stable after many years
- new synapses are formed on a dendrite after a learning and rest cycle
- synapses are less than a micron in diameter
  - human hair is 10 microns in diameter
- so, technically, a brain wakes up with an upgrade when it wakes up
  - insomnia affects learning and problem solving skills
- [brain behavior reference](https://www.brainfacts.org)


#### procrasination 

- arises from the fact that you can be working only on one thing at a time
- if one thing is being worked on, other things are not being worked on

- when a activity that is not desirable to do is considered, the pain centers (insular cortex) in the brain are activated
- the brain is designed to look for paths to avoid that negative experience
  - however, for some activities, the pain centers get activated less when the brain learns to do the activity better
  
  
###### procrastination and pomodoro

- pomodoro is italian for learning
- it is allegedly a technique of using a timer 
  - 25 minutes of uninterrupted work
  - then a reward at the end of the 25 minutes for focussing
    - may include a cup of coffee, bite of chocolate, sex, strecthing, mindless chatting etc
- the goal is to rest the focussed thinking mode and turn on the resitng mode 
  - key is there should be no focussed activity after that 25 minutes
  


###### practice makes permanent

- neural thought patterns are real physical objects 
- they are weak when a new thing is being learnt 
- practise makes these patterns strong i.e. permanent
- a little eveyrday helps build a strong foundation while learning something new 
- all at one causes the learning system to fail and associate negative thoughts to the idea of learning and the thing being learnt
- this strengthens procrastination
- so pomodoro technique is usedto avoid too much at once to prevent learning overload


#### memory

- spaced repetetion helps settle in new concepts stronger
- while learning something new, repeating it 20 times spread across 20 days is better than 20 times in a single day 

- on the same lines pomodoro is done in cycles of 30 minutes, with 5 minutes of break between each 25 minute block


#### sleep

- the wake state creates neuro toxins in the brain
- during sleep, neurons shrink and the brain fluid washes the toxins out 
- sleep helps brain clean up toxins, so it is an essential part of brian maintainence
- lack of sleep increases toxicity in the brain and prvents it from functioning correctly
  - sacrificing sleep is like shooting one self in the foot
- too little sleep for a long period of time causes headaches, depression, heart diseases, diabetes and causes earlier death
- during sleep the brain rehearses some of the tougher parts of whatever is being learnt 
  - the temporary deactivation of the prefrontal cortex during sleep helps the other parts of the brain talk easily to one other
  - this helps them put together solutions to new taks begin learned
  - dreaming allegedly consolidates memories into easier to grasp chunks
  
- execrise also is allegedly supposed to improve learning and memory capabilities


*** 

## chunking

- a chunk is like creating a zip file of many ideas
  - like stitching together a word from letters
  
- a chunk is a piece of information neurologically speaking 
  - a symphony of neurons firing together
  - to think a thought or do an action
  
- focussed mode learning helps start forming chunks 
  - but stress, anger and fear block this 
  
#### forming chunks

- grasping small patterns of the big picture 
- then graudaully knitting them together 
- when done with proper learning technqiues, leads to the ability of doing it without applying much thought

- chunking for every topic is a bit different
- however, the underlying mental scheme is the same
  - get the main idea first 
  - then break it into as many pieces as possible
- seeing the problem being solved helps provife the big picture

- just because the problem solving process was observed, expertise isnt implied 
  - aha != expertise
- many things are understood only after it is done without looking at the sample provided
  - like seeing a painting or listening to a song desnt mean you can create it

- there are three elements in the scheme of chunking
  - big picture
  - context
  - chunks
  
- top down process: big-picture and context linking 
- botton up process: chucnk and context linking
- mastery requires both these linkings to happen correctly
  - focussed attention
  - understanding with diffused leanring 
  - temporally spaced practise

## illusions of competence 

- typically re-doing the material learned is used to develop further understanding 
  - however, this is counter productive and inefficient
  - it is more useful to try to recall what was read the first time
    - without looking 
    - this is the recall technique 
    - to be used instead of re-doing method  
  - the recall process itself aids deeper learning 
    - helps forms better chunks for firing neurons

- the only time re-doing helps is when there more time between two iterations 
  - as this works as a spaced repetition
  - there needs to be a sleep and wake cycle between each iteration 
  
- sometimes taking notes and writing down material can fool the brain into thinking you've learnt the material 

- mnistakes are helpful to find out holes in understanding 
- mistakes can be corrected bit by bit to improve depth and quality of understanding 
  - and this is why tests exist

## ease of learning 

- it is harder to learn when there is no inderest in the topic
- it is easy to learn when motivated and interested in the topic
  - this is becasue the neurons in the cortex carry information about what is happening around you
  - and actions
- brain also has diffusely projecting systems of neuromodulators that carry information 
  - these carry information about the value of the experience content 
  - not the content itself 

#### neuromodulators 

- includes (not limited to) acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin
- these have a profound impact on unconscious mind


###### acetylcholine

- these neurons form neuromodulatory connection to the cortex that are particulary important for focused learning when paying lcose attention
- project widely and activate circuits that control synaptic palsticity leading to new long term memory 

###### dopamine

- dopamine allegedly 'controls' motivation
  - they are a part of a large reward-learning system

- dopamine is found in small set of neurons in the mid-brain
  - partcularly in the basal ganglia just above the mid-brain 
  - below the cortex of the top brain
  
- dopamine signals project widely and have a powerful effect on learning 
  - they are released when we receive and unexpected reward
  - also affects decision-making and the value of the sensory inputs 

- dopamine is in the business of precdicting future rewards 
  - not just the immediate rewards
  - this can motivate you to do something right now that may be not a instataneously rewarding 
  - but may lead to a better reward in the future 
  
- addictive drugs artificially increase dopamine activity and fool brain into thinking that something wornderful has happened 
  - leads ot craving and dependence which can hijack free will 
  - and motivate harmful behavior
  
- loss of dopamine neurons leads to lack of motivation and 
  - something called "anhedoina" 
  - which is a loss of interest in things that once gave you pleasure
  
- severe loss of dopamine neurons causes resting tremors, slowness, rigidity, parkinson's disease 
  - ultimately leads to catatonia, a complete lack of any movement 

- dopamine neurons are part of the unconscious brain
- when using reward-promise in the pomodoro technique, it is essentially tapping into the dopamine mechanism 

###### serotonin

- diffuse neuromodulatory system that strongly affects social life 
- in monkey troops, the alpha male has the highest level of serotonin activity
- lowest ranking male has lowest ranking activity 
- prozac, which is the medication for clinical depression, 
  - increases serotonin activity
- serotonin is also closely related risk-taking behavior
  - higher risk in lower serotonin monkeys 
- jailed inmates have the lowest recorded levels of serotonin 


#### emotions 

- emotions strongly affect learning 
- emotions are entwined with perception, and attention span
- emotions interact with learning and memory 

- the amygdala is a part of the limbic system
  - along with the hippocampus, is involved in memory and decision-making 
  - regulating emotional reactions 
- the amygdala must be happy to be an effective learner

- emotions and neuromodulatory systems are slower than perception and action
  - but hold same importance in learning process
