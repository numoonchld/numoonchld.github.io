## learning modes 

- in line with how the brain works according to the brain's working 
  - two fundamentally different modes of learning 
    - focussed mode 
    - diffused mode 
    
- both metaphor and analogy are useful when learning something new
- cannot be in both thinking modes at the same time
  - like a coin, cannot see both side of a coin at the same time

#### focussed mode

- this is like a pinball machine with densely spaced bumpers 
- thoughts are like the ball in the machine
- patterns are how the pinball maves in between the bumpers 
- there are only so many patterns possible 
- relies on diffuse thinking mode to get new patterns
  - SNR of new patterns is subtle until it fully sets in
- zombie like thinking 
- cast light strongly in one path, while leaving the rest dark
- the pinball cant go very far, but useful for step-by-step problem solving 

#### diffused mode

- this is like a pinball machine with sparsely spaced bumpers 
- diffused thinking mode is a broad, big picture process
- necessary for understandng something hasnt been understood before
- necessary for finding solutions for problems that have not been faced before
- brings in new thought patterns into the metaphorical pinball frame
- does not cost light in one region strongly, but lights up all areas diffusely

- brain has amazing ablities, but no instruction manual
