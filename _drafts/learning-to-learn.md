- doctors are told at the beginning of their degree that half the things they learn during their degree will be moot by the time they graduate 
  - so there is something to be said about constant learning 
  - and something to be said about the hyprocrite's oath

## learning modes 

- in line with how the brain works according to the brain's working 
  - two fundamentally different modes of learning 
    - focussed mode 
    - diffused mode 
    
- both metaphor and analogy are useful when learning something new
- cannot be in both thinking modes at the same time
  - like a coin, cannot see both side of a coin at the same time

#### focussed mode

- this is like a pinball machine with densely spaced bumpers 
- thoughts are like the ball in the machine
- patterns are how the pinball maves in between the bumpers 
- there are only so many patterns possible 
- relies on diffuse thinking mode to get new patterns
  - SNR of new patterns is subtle until it fully sets in
- zombie like thinking 
- cast light strongly in one path, while leaving the rest dark
- the pinball cant go very far, but useful for step-by-step problem solving 

#### diffused mode

- this is like a pinball machine with sparsely spaced bumpers 
- diffused thinking mode is a broad, big picture process
- necessary for understandng something hasnt been understood before
- necessary for finding solutions for problems that have not been faced before
- brings in new thought patterns into the metaphorical pinball frame
- does not cost light in one region strongly, but lights up all areas diffusely

## using the modes

- brain has amazing ablities, but no instruction manual
- a lot of crazy dead people (Thomas Edison, Salvodor Dali) used to almost fall asleep and harras themselves into waking up using tricks
  - to force the diffuse thinking and then gather the new thoughts in their waking state
  
- similar to body-building, a little neural work in diffused and focussed thinking has to be done everyday under a regiment to strengthen the two systems
  - constant effort is the T R I C K
  
- learning something difficult takes takes time, and more so for people conditioned with only one type of thinking 

#### learning 

- the brain is allegedly useful to learn new things
- it supposedly consumes three time more energy per unit weigth compared to the rest of the body
  - thoughts, hopes and fears are allegedly in the neurons of the brain
- chess and math are supposedly prized abilities of the brain
  - reading being able to screw fellow humans 
  - and keep tabs on fellow humans 
- most of the heavy lifting is done under the hood, in the subsconscious
  - it is not necessary to know how this works to survive
- different parts of the brain are active during interaction with the world and when resting
  - the parts dedicated to interacting with the world turn off when resting and vice-versa
- brain connections are dynamic, even after it matures
- new synapses are formed and other disappear
  - memory is still stable after many years
- new synapses are formed on a dendrite after a learning and rest cycle
- synapses are less than a micron in diameter
  - human hair is 10 microns in diameter
- so, technically, a brain wakes up with an upgrade when it wakes up
  - insomnia affects learning and problem solving skills
