- procrastination and memory are related 
  - building solid long-term memory that are easily accessible by short term memory takes time 
  - doesnt work if put off to last minute
  
- learning is about fending off procrastination to learn with consistency 
  - a little every day (assuming a sleep cycle between sessions)
  - after establishing the big picture - scanning 
  - consciously using retrieval to create chunks 
  - interleaving between techniques after scanning the big picture
  
- pomodoro technique is the tool to combat procrastination 
  - use recall to build healthy chunks 
  - use interleaving to solidify chunks
  
- there are ways to 
  - tackle procrastination which take low amounts of will power 
  - access brain's long term memory system

## inner zombies 

- inner zombies prevent taking action for bit-by-bit learning 
- they provide narratives to put off that little bit that makes the differnce 
  - they throw a wet blanket on the consistenct efforts required for the spaced repetition learning
  - it is not about how much repetetion is done in one sessson i.e. cramming
  - it is about spaced repetitions in between sleep cycles
- this calls for starting earlier 
- fighting procrastination with willpower is inefficient and uses a lot of natural resources 

- procrastination is associated with pain 
  - it is because the thing we are trying to learn makes us uncomfortable 
  - it activates pain centers in the brain
  - this causes the brain to focus attention on something less displeasurable

- when procrastination is not countered with wisdom, it leads to habitual avoidance 
  - this leads to long term ill-effects of running away from difficult things 
  - instead of conquering them
- making procrastination a monumental keystone bad habit 
  - overtime, the brain weaves narratives to keep you away from the thing to be conquered
  - the narratives are superficially sound and fool your thinking 
  - but in the long run they are irrational and cause loss of development
  
- tests choke you because there is no strong neural foundation for the test material 

- the strategies for dealing with inner zombies aren't intuitive 
  - in fact it is more intuitive to give in to inner zombies 
  
- the habitual avoidance can be explained with the story of the arsenic eaters 

- arsenic is a poison, however it is not harmful in small doses
  - so a couple of eaters built up resiliency to arsenic but consuming small amounts of arsenic periodically, 
  - graudally increasing the amounts they took as their body developed more immunity 
  - one fine day, they presented their ability at a medical conference by consuming whole bottles of arsenic
  - and showed up happy and normal the next day
  
- while certain pain centers are activated when things make us uncomfortable, it helps knowing that the body develops resiliency and pains can be overcome by normalization 
  - the opposite it true as well, if avoidance is practised, the avoidance narratives get more sophisticated 
  - only pain avoidance is focussed on
  - while pain avoidance is fine and dandy and helps reduce hospital bills, it is counter to being able to learn new things
