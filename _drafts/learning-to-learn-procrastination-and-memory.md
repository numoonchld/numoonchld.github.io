- procrastination and memory are related 
  - building solid long-term memory that are easily accessible by short term memory takes time 
  - doesnt work if put off to last minute
  
- learning is about fending off procrastination to learn with consistency 
  - a little every day (assuming a sleep cycle between sessions)
  - after establishing the big picture - scanning 
  - consciously using retrieval to create chunks 
  - interleaving between techniques after scanning the big picture
  
- pomodoro technique is the tool to combat procrastination 
  - use recall to build healthy chunks 
  - use interleaving to solidify chunks
  
- there are ways to 
  - tackle procrastination which take low amounts of will power 
  - access brain's long term memory system

## inner zombies 

- inner zombies prevent taking action for bit-by-bit learning 
- they provide narratives to put off that little bit that makes the differnce 
  - they throw a wet blanket on the consistenct efforts required for the spaced repetition learning
  - it is not about how much repetetion is done in one sessson i.e. cramming
  - it is about spaced repetitions in between sleep cycles
- this calls for starting earlier 
- fighting procrastination with willpower is inefficient and uses a lot of natural resources 

- procrastination is associated with pain 
  - it is because the thing we are trying to learn makes us uncomfortable 
  - it activates pain centers in the brain
  - this causes the brain to focus attention on something less displeasurable

- when procrastination is not countered with wisdom, it leads to habitual avoidance 
  - this leads to long term ill-effects of running away from difficult things 
  - instead of conquering them
- making procrastination a monumental keystone bad habit 
  - overtime, the brain weaves narratives to keep you away from the thing to be conquered
  - the narratives are superficially sound and fool your thinking 
  - but in the long run they are irrational and cause loss of development
  
- tests choke you because there is no strong neural foundation for the test material 

- the strategies for dealing with inner zombies aren't intuitive 
  - in fact it is more intuitive to give in to inner zombies 
  
- the habitual avoidance can be explained with the story of the arsenic eaters 

- arsenic is a poison, however it is not harmful in small doses
  - so a couple of eaters built up resiliency to arsenic but consuming small amounts of arsenic periodically, 
  - graudally increasing the amounts they took as their body developed more immunity 
  - one fine day, they presented their ability at a medical conference by consuming whole bottles of arsenic
  - and showed up happy and normal the next day
  
- while certain pain centers are activated when things make us uncomfortable, it helps knowing that the body develops resiliency and pains can be overcome by normalization 
  - the opposite it true as well, if avoidance is practised, the avoidance narratives get more sophisticated 
  - only pain avoidance is focussed on
  - while pain avoidance is fine and dandy and helps reduce hospital bills, it is counter to being able to learn new things

## habits 

- habits are built in energy savers 
  - it helps automate tasks so newer or more relevant taks can be focussed on
  - but habits also create zombies 

- it is useful to be aware of the purpose of the habitual zombies created in the brain
  - at any given point in time, there is a superpositon of serveral zombies active with in you
  - this is very useful for saving energy
- however, since this system is a subconsious system, it often gets abused 

- habit can be god or bad depending on who is coloring it 

#### anatomy of an inner zombie

1. cue
2. routine
3. reward
4. belief

###### cue 

- the trigger that launches the zombie mode 
- can be various event 
  - subtle to drastic 
  - ties into body language mechanisms

###### routine 

- the actual zombie mode 
- the same zombie in different circumstances 
  - can be exretmely useful
  - or extremely harmful
  - or anything in between

###### reward 

- the very nature of habits is such that there is a reward associated with it
- the reward solidifies the habit
- reward in the physical world can be doing somehting pleasureable
  - in the brain, it translates to some appropriate chemical being released 
  - dopamine for instance when an addictive behavior is catered to 
- the reward system needs to be addressed while forming and solidifying good habits 
  - procrastination, for instance, has a built in reward mechanism
  - to combat this, the external reard system has to be addressed

###### beliefs

- this is a more abstract topic and needs more research to be understood better
- in short, beliefs and habits enforce each other
- a habit formation can change a previously held belief
- a changed belief can change a habit 
- a bad habit that is left untended to can reinforce a self-defeating belief
- a healthy habit can strengthen positive beliefs

## process vs product

- it is expected behavior to start with negative vibes when learning something new 
  - it helps to addressing these direcctly with a rant session of some sort 
  - with the intention of completely acknowledging it in its enitrity to move past it 

- the law of serendipity is one of the available tools to get going in the face of these negative vibes and feelings
- another technique to mix in while learning a new thing is differentiating the process from the product 
  - the process has to developed while using the product as a indicator to asses how to process can be made better, not as the end goal 
  
###### process
- process is the flow of time + ( the habits and actions ) in the flow of time
- in the pomodoro technique for instance, the 25 min session is the process

###### product 
- this is outcome of the process time

#### procrastination

- a disproportionate amount of focus on the final product with 
  - too much weight assigned to achieving a perfect product 
  - works in favor of prcrastination
  
- if the product in the first attmept is expected to be perfect, 
  - it triggers pain centers in a pronounced way 
  - deterring further focussed action
  - triggering procrastination

- focussing on creating a perfect product when learning
  - deters formation of healthy chunks
  - inefficient and incoherent chunks are formed
  - leading to a useless foundation
  - further discouraging the learner from the learning process
  - setting up negative narratives about learning, 
  - strengthening procrastination patterns
  
- focus on the process to get better at learning and creating the product 
  - this deters procrastination as a by-product
  - increases speed of learning, by forming healthy and coherent chunks
  
- this is illustrated in a situation where a homework is just five questions 
  - but the answers take hours of focussed work and involved reasoning to obtain
  - it is easy to begin with saying it's just five questions and getting into it focussing on getting five answers 
  - however this is product focussed action
    - and encourages procrastination
  - even if efforts are put in 
    - considering there are 'just' five answers to be obtained,
    - it leads to poor learning and misdirected effort
    - since focus in answer generation and not healthy and coherent chunk creation

- it would be healthier for the learning system to consider the task as coming up with five processes instead of the five final answers 
  - the point is to not expect oneself to finish in one session to begin with 
  - this ensures a massively shitty product 
  - with a 'thrown together at the last moment' vibes 
  
- the goal is to distribute the process over several sessions 
  - so usefully-challenged chunks are not formed 
  - calm focus has to be spent in short pieces of time to create potent chunks 
  
- the zombie brain (para-symapthetic) likes to march mindlessly along process 
  - it is beneficial to empower this zombie with coherent and solid chunks 
  - since the zombie is a time saver 

- so in a pomodoro session, finishing a set percent of the task is not the goal
  - it is about focussing on the process associated with that time span
  - process means the habit forming and actions assocaited with the considered time span

- focussing on the process helps reduce the negative vibes of the self-judgement for not being able to produce a perfecrt final product in the first go

- to combat distractions, it is helpful to let it flow and not encouraging it 
  - also setting up oneself for lesser distraction is great
  - learning in a coffee shop looks great in a stock picture 
    - to be used on a corporate website
  - but does not work so well in forming useful chunks 
    - handicapped chunks are the result of working amidst distractions
    
- poor attempt at humor:
  - drink alcohol to kill those handicapped chunks in your brain
