### Light  

Photography, in one of the ancient languages, literally means “to write light”. So, it only makes sense to start photography by understanding what light is. It also helps to understand who causes the writing and what’s writing the light within the context of this process.

From a physics standpoint, light is a bit of a split personality if you will. 

- One avatar of light is that of a wave, with alternating electric and magnetic waves perpendicular to each other propagating through space. 
- Light, alternatively, can be treated as a sea of photons, which are little packets of energy. 
- This split-persona of light is called wave-particle duality.

The speed at which light travels is the fastest anything in known existence can travel. And as it travels through space, it is slowed down by the medium it travels in. When it collides with objects, it gets reflected or absorbed by them.

- From a living organism’s standpoint, an optimal amount of light is necessary to observe it’s environment for survival. 
- From the standpoint of a living organism that wants to take pictures with a camera, light is necessary to illuminate the scene of photographic interest. 
- From a camera’s standpoint, light is the signal that it’s sensor captures and stores. 

There are various sources of light. Broadly, there are natural and artificial light sources. Either maybe used creatively to create photographs.

### Camera 

A camera is a device with all the mechanical and electrical components necessary to capture light and write to an analog or digital medium. 

Photo-films used to be a popular medium of capturing light signals - the analog way of photography. 

Digital cameras are equipped with an electronic sensor. This is the site for collecting light and generating a corresponding digital representation. 

##### Anatomy 

<br>
### Perspective Principles:

- Image plane: this is the sensor plane where the actual image is formed 
- Line of Sight: the direction at the which the camera body and lens setup is pointed at 
- Cone of Vision: the cone of light that is let in through the lens 
- Scene/Field of View: the visual (light EM signal) information that the cone of vision brings into the camera lens
- Subject: the thing of interest in the scene, typically the object of focus
- Foreground: the space between the subject and the lens
- Background: the space behind the subject, away from the lens

### Frame, Sensors Size 

The light capturing site is a limited physical area. Various sensor sizes exist and the sensor size unique to every camera model. Typically, these sensors are flat and rectangular in shape, like the photo-films.

35mm x 24mm sensor corresponds to the size of a film, and those sensors in the realm of this size are deemed full-frame sensors, with a crop-factor of 1.

<br>

The sensor’s surface area is divided into a few million sites called “picture elements” or *pixel*s. Each site registers an intensity value based on the amount of light received at the pixel location on the sensor, using a digitizer. For an 8-bit sensor these intensities are between 0 and 255, where 0 is for no light and 255 for the brightest light. So every digital image is a grid of such intensity values. 

Typically, for a color sensor, three values - Red, Green, and Blue values are recorded and a composite of these three grids helps represent the captured scene. 

The camera body houses the sensor in a protective casing. The casing also contains housing for the battery (electric power supply), User Interface display, and user input knobs and buttons. 

Since the sensor has a limited area, it helps set the bounds of the light to be captured.

### Exposure and F-Stop: 

- overall exposure triangle 
- perspective from each corner 
- ISO 
- Shutter Speed
- Aperture

Exposure is the amount of light that the sensor is exposed to at the event of capture. Light from the scene travels into the lens through the aperture opening of the lens tube and reaches the shutter. The capture event is time bound by a shutter, which open and closes to let the light in onto the sensor chip for a fixed amount of time. The sensor registers the light intensities based on current sensitivity setting.


##### ISO and Dynamic Range

The ISO is the sensor’s sensitivity to light. This can generally be set and the bounds vary by make and model. Usually user adjustable. In simpler UIs, the camera app algorithm sets the ISO automatically. 

When sensitivity is low, a larger amount of light is necessary to make the digitizer register the same intensity value for when the sensitivity is high and there is lesser light available. 
    

##### Shutter Speed

The shutter sets the time the sensor chip is exposed to the light to register the intensity values. A faster speed lets light in for a shorter time, resulting in lesser light. A slower shutter speed results in a longer exposure of the sensor to incoming light. 		

##### Lenses Aperture 

Lenses allow for the focussing on a part of the scene. This is achieved by a complex setup of glass parts moving with respect to the sensor plane. Lenses are equipped to aperture in this complex setup to adjust size of hole that allows light to come through the lens on to the shutter. Bigger the opening, more the light allowed on to the sensor and greater the exposure


<br>
### Focus and Depth of Focus

- A lens’ mechanism allows for focus to be set for objects in different depths in the field of view
- The aperture setting in the lens allows for the depth of focus to be altered. While aperture helps in controlling exposure, a by-product is setting the depth of field
- Smaller the aperture, lesser the light entering, but also the deeper depth of focus i.e. more planes perpendicular to the line of sight are in focus, similar to how squinting can help see things further away
- A larger aperture allows a lot more light, but the number of planes perpendicular to the line of sight reduces exponentially (citation needed), a lot of the foreground and background appears out of focus while keeping only the subject in sharp focus
