title: accuracy, smoothness and speed
---

**Quotes in the universal collective:** *(also, it was on the internet so it must be true)*

* Slow is smooth, smooth is fast, so slow is fast.

* Speed is a by product of accuracy.

* Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.

* Haste makes waste.  

**Hypothesis:**

Slow, smooth and accurate action results in substantially less time consumed in achieving desired goals.
