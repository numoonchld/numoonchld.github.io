## the nervous system 

four basic functions of the central nervous system:
- voluntary movement
- perception
- homeostasis
- cognition 

#### voluntary movement

driven by the brain; voluntary and involuntary expressions, such as:
- facial expressions
- raising your hand
- jumping up and down
- dance steps 

is lost in people with locked-in syndrome for example

#### perception

- perception is what is consciously appreciated about sensation - not the same as sensation 
- sensory brain monitors CO_2 in the blood, organ chemical, muscle lengths etc., i.e. all the physical and chemical characteristics of the body, but this is at a sub-system level 
- the actual amounts don't reach the conscious perception 
- perception is vision and hearing, smell and taste, the sense of balance, the sense of position in the world. Where are we? Where is our head in the world? A sense of equilibrium

#### homeostasis

- homeostasis is what we use to keep our body in physiological limits, which the bodsy can tolerate

- there are life cycle events that are challenges to our being
    - these include giving birth, and nursing a newborn, suckling from a mother - all of these things are part of homeostasis
    - Another part of homeostasis is a rhythm
        - daily rhythm: the wake and the sleep
        - seasonal rhythm: has a little bit less of an obvious influence
        - the cycle of life: we go from infancy, to childhood, to adolescence, early adulthood, to middle age, to being older
        
#### cognition

- these are abstract functions
    - thinking 
    - feeling emotions, and 
    - motivation
    - language, and 
    - memory, and 
    - learning
    - interaction with others

## neurons

- lung cells, liver cells, kidney cells, etc. might five, ten different types but after that - out of variation
- neurons are unique, they could be categorized into a million different types 
- they are the longest cells in the body 
    - the longest neuron starts at the big toe and ends at the back of the spinal cord; in really tall people, that one neuron can be 6 ft 

#### parts of the neuron

- four parts:
    - cell body: soma - the center of the cell body
    - dendrites: they receive information from sypnases and relay it to the cell center
    - arbor: the tree of branching of dendrites, locally dense 
    - axon: only one axon per neuron and can go far distances in the body

- synapse: space terminating one axon connecting the next neuron
    - information travels along the axon and ends up at the communication center that the synapse is
    - at the synapse, the axon gives the information to the next terminal in line
    - so synapse is the point of information transfer
