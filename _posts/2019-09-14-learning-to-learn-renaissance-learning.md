1. physical exercise is the best gift to the brain
    - in a few places of the brain, new neurons are born everyday
    - hippocampus
        - important area for learning new things
        - new neurons help in improved pattern recognition
        - they die if they are not used
        - exercise helps the new neurons survive
            - better than any drugs on the market
        - also benefits all body organs

2. practice makes permanent 
    - only when the brain is prepared 
    - critical period of learning specific skills
    - first language acquisition - extends up to puberty
    - past the critical period, process takes much longer 

3. the prefrontal cortex separates humans and zombies
    - patients turn into zombies when their prefrontal cortex is damaged
    - there is a certain amount of zombie is humans until the pre-frontal cortex is fully developed
    - although IQ can still be high, 
        - bad financial decisions and
        - bad social decisions happen through a damaged pre frontal cortex
    - good judgement takes experience with learning to acquire
    - as a result learning is too important to be left behind in the classroom
    - learning to learn may be applied for improved learning in all parts of life

***

- when learning new things, things that made sense before might make no sense
- restructuring to existing learning occurs when learning new things
    - there may be temporary periods of frustration due to restructuring existing understanding with the new materials learnt
    - a good night's sleep and spaced repetition usually fixes this

- visual metaphors and analogies to understand new concepts
    - they can be made more sophisticated as the concept is learned more deeply 
    - they help glue new ideas into the mind as they link new concepts to existing patterns

- impostor syndrome 
    - stems from genius envy
    - chunking and interleaving along with spaced repetition helps learn a new skill
    - once a pattern has been understood and memorized
        - there is no need to explain it over and over again to yourself
    - if someone is forcing you to do this beyond a certain point
        - they are trying to scam you
        - sometimes it is a honest attempt at recollecting a concept
        - but be wary, this quickly turns into malice

- be aware of where einstellung is blocking you from learning new concepts
    - it hard to identify old zombies
    - using a smaller working memory helps 
    - as other ideas can come in more
    - it helps to write down existing thoughts to clear up working memory

- keep your chin up and eye on the open door
    - it takes time to find the open door with existing zombies crowding mental space

#### social response to learning

- there will always be a set of people dedicated to criticize or attempt to undermine your learning 
    - keep in mind that those who are dedicated to self development will not have the time to do this
    - this happens to everyone including nobel prize winners
    - like how in school, people are threatened by you when you do well 
        - focus on the phenomenon of insecurity that is caused by your actions
        - only in people who choose to be threatened instead of being inspired
- the greater your achievement, the more people attack
    - there will also be attempt to demean you and shame you for other aspects
    - anything to bring you down 
        - look up crab mentality
    - they will even paint it as looking out for you and 'testing' you
        - to stay in your good books 
    - essentially jealously has a myriad of forms
- this gets amplified when you are learning something new and fail at an attempt
    - a lot of people throw barbs are criticize you for your failures 
    - when they would be watching silently without cheering you when you succeed 
    - they are stuck in lower levels of consciousness 
    - simple stick to your path, keeping in mind that they do not offer value to your learning and growth as a human being 
        - and they actively sabotage their own learning when they throw barbs at other's growth

- there is a statement that says empathy is universally beneficial 
    - this is false propaganda 
    - benefits only the people who want to stay stuck in their ways and throw barbs in other's growth
    - a healthy disconnect from empathy for such people is a requirement for growth 
        - no need for malice to these people
        - but there needs to be a healthy disregard for them, considering how they bring no value to the table of growth and learning 

- it is normal to believe that everyone believes in the cause of self growth and learning
    - it is is easy to believe that everyone is good hearted towards us
    - in the real world, people are assholes
        - sometimes just to prove that other people can be assholes 
        - and claim to be 'teaching' you about the real world
    - work achieved inspite of such deterrents leads to a sense of pride 
        - prejudices from others do not add value to your world
        - disconnect and tarry on self development 


#### teamwork

- stroke of the right hemisphere causes broad-perspective perceptual disorder 
    - big picture inconsistencies don't stand out to people with this disorder


- 'right-brained' and 'left-brained' thinking is a pop-culture myth
    - while left and right hemispheres have some dedicated functions 
    - thinking type is reserved to one hemisphere alone

- people with damages to right hemisphere are unable to stitch together details 
    - cannot have aha moments 
    - global-thinking, context-dependent thinking and figural processes are hindered
    - reality checks system is affected
    - cannot play devil's advocate to check global inconsistencies

- people with left hemisphere damages have trouble with language processing 
    - cannot hold on to things of status quo 


- revisit the same material with a bigger picture in mind
    - in the second spaced repetition

- in the focussed mode of thinking, it is easy to make minor mistakes 
    - if a mistake is made early on, then even if the rest of the work is right, the learned material might be completely wrong
    - practice makes permanent, not perfect 

- due to years of malconditioning, certain types of thinking have been attributed to left brain style and some other to the right brain style
    - left style is extreme focus without caring for the right brain style of globally consistent answers
        - focussed mode type thinking
        - i.e. calculating the circumference of the earth and finding the result to be 3.5 meters  
        - damaged right brain and over active left brain style would lead to the person not being bothered by this answer at all
        - rigidity, dogmatic, analytic, egocentricity
    - right style thinking is diffuse and big picture oriented 
        - diffuse mode type thinking
        - i.e. the methodology of finding the circumference and what the circumference means in the big picture will be explained by them till the cows come home
        - but they are incapable of actual step by step problem solving to arrive at the answer

- it is easy to fool oneself with pride of either kind of thinking 
    - some dead fucker: "the first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool" 
    - example: when a student gets the answer right because of rigid ways of problems solving methods taught in class
    - example: when student figures out tests all by themselves without the help of formal training 
    - overconfidence in results results in using only one mode of thinking 
    - pride caused by either kind of thinking results in fooling oneself into thinking you understand the subject more than you actually do 

- blinking and breathing helps to catch the brain fooling itself into thinking it has been productive or learned something

- to help catch blind-spots in thinking and perspective, brain storming in a team of people who are SIMILARLY aligned in terms of the interest and knowledge in the topic being learned about proves valuable
    - the rationale is everyone has blind spots but when working together, they can null out each others blindspots
    - this is counter-productive if the study sessions turn into socializing hangouts or impromptu orgies

#### testing 

- powerful learning experience 
- includes at the recall mini tests 

- more gets retained during time spent testing that generic reading and memorization
- tests are emotionally fueled as there is a certain amount of validation involved
    - so different focus systems in the nervous system gets activated  

##### preparing for proficiency in a subject 

- make sincere attempts to understand what is being conveyed by the test
- work with peers to solve problems
- outline the steps of the problems solved
- actively participate in group discussions
- consult with a person who is more knowledgeable
- understand all problems you spend time solving
- ask the more knowledgeable person or peers when some concept used to solve a problem is not clearly understood
- use guides to pick up normalized knowledge about the subject
- outline the solutions to a lot of different types of problems quickly
- get sleep to actually assimilate learning from all these steps 

#### test taking 

- approach #1: 
    - solve the simple problems first to build confidence to solve tougher problems
    - for many people this counter productive 

- difficult longer length problems need the power of diffuse power thinking 
    - however, to access diffuse mode thinking, focus on what needs to solving has to be turned down 

- approach #2:
    - start with hard problem, get stuck
        - consolidate clearly what you do not know that is keeping your from solving the problem
        - loads the problem in mind
    - then jump to easy problem
        - the diffuse mode keeps working on the hard problem subconsciously 


#### stress

- cortisol - stress hormone 
- the self-narrative used under stressful conditions can potentially improve outcome of stressful situation
- the response to stress hormones have to be engineered to steer oneself towards positive outcomes
- conscious abdominal deep-breathing calms down the cortisol induced fight-or-flight response
    - helps with better self-narratives
    - practice this technique to make the pattern auto-trigger in response to stress hormones
    - oxygen surplus is great to deal with a great influx of cortisol



- "good worry" vs "bad worry"
    - worry provides a bit of drive 
    - in toxic amounts, drains energy to do anything tangible with the drive
    - worry can get self-defeating very quickly
    - especially if this is the habitualizied source of drive 

- sleep is underrated in terms of learning and taking tests 
    - clears out toxins from the CSF
    - consolidates learning from outer memory to core memory 
    - consistent sleep supplemented learning leads to faster permanence of thing learned


#### closing 

- care must be taken to learn the right thing
    - when practising as practice doesn't make perfect, ito nly makes permanent
- if the right thing it practiced, it gets more refined due to short term and long term reconsolidation
    - allowing it to be perceived as permanent

- you have truly learned something only when you can teach it to others in simple words 
    - by boiling down the core ideas into easily digestible chunks
    - and being able to explain it concisely and in an easily understandable way
