# 3D graphics production 

##### static renders

- image of a scene

##### dynamics renders

- video of a story

<hr>

# static 3D production  

### modelling:
- asset generation stage
- ranges from simple models to whole worlds and ecosystems

### sculpting:
- organic modelling 
- usually done after a very geometric and mathematical base model is created with primitives
    - depends on the elements in the final render
    - organic elements need sculpting
- sculpting is done to make the model more true to reality 
    - by adding character through geometric/mathematical imperfections 
    - using dedicated sculpting tools that varies from application to application 

### texturing:
- is done either to the base geometric model or the sculpted model 
- this is to add material to the surfaces of the 3D assets
- can vary from metals to plastic, to transparent glasses and everything in between and outside
- this can range from being simple to very involved 
    - might be used in lieu of sculpting in some scenarios 

### lighting:
- the materials from the texturing stage interact with light to produce different results 
- the lighting of the scene is experimented with to obtain acceptable results
- virtual lighting setups along with diffusion and reflective surfaces are used to produce scene-appropriate lighting

### posing 
- if humanoid or animal like characters are involved, their poses are adjusted for the final render 
- the lighting is usually adjusted in tandem with the pose of the characters 

### rendering:
- creating the final image 
    - output of the 3D production 
- position the camera appropriately, setup right lens and depth of field configurations 
- more complex scenes with more intricate light paths take more computational power and time to render 
- render engines and settings are crucial to balance the time taken to render and the quality of the render 

### compositing 
- 3D renders are merged intelligently with real images to create augmented reality images 
- has a wide variety of applications including mixing computer graphics elements with real world elements to create a fictional scene

<hr>

# dynamic 3D production

- this includes the same steps as static 3D production 
- has more steps to make the assets move 
    - adjust light and camera movement 
    - compositing is more involved for merging computer generated elements with video footage

### rigging 

- this is the one salient step that separates static and dynamic production before rendering 
- posing is for static scenes, rigging takes it its place in dynamic 3D production
- posing extended in time leads to rigging 
    - the position and orientation of all elements in the scene can be assigned different values in time 
- rigging is at the core of animation 
    - can range from very gross to very nuanced scales, depending on the scene 

### video editing

- after rendering, the animation clips have to arranged coherently in a time-line for the underlying story to make sense 
- this is usually done after video compositing 

<hr> 

# 3D printing 

- taking it a notch further, static assets can be printed into 3D objects with appropriate 3D printing devices 
- assets can be produced in a software like blender 
- they are then fed into a 3D printing machine
    - this outputs a real-life, usually scaled, model of the asset
