- a long time ago, but not too long ago, but quite long ago, there lived a fakir outside a village

- a wild watermelon patch had cropped up outside the village
  - the villagers, who had never seen a watermelon before, happened across the watermelon patch 
  - they grew fearful of the watermelons and threw stones at it, thinking it was the demon

- the fakir, who knew what a watermelon was, decided to resolve their confusion
  - while the villagers were throwing stones at the watermelon patch, the fakir approached them and stopped them 

- he advised the villagers to stop throwing stones and observe the patch for a week instead 
  - the villagers noticed that the watermelons had done nothing in the week 
  
- the fakir then told them to observe the watermelons from a closer distance for the next week 
  - the villagers again saw that the watermelons did nothing
  
- this continued until the villagers were right next to the watermelons in the patch 
  - that day, the fakir brought a pocket knife along with him
  - he touched the watermelon and demonstrated to the villagers that the watermelon was harmless

- he pulled a watermelon out from the patch
  - gave it the [ripeness test](https://www.thespruceeats.com/picking-ripe-watermelon-2356044){: target="_blank"} with his fingers 
  - and cut open the watermelon with his pocket knife
  
- he then ate a piece of watermelon
  - this horrified the villagers
  - but the fakir enjoyed eating it 
  - so this put the villagers at ease somewhat
  
- the fakir offered the villagers a piece to eat
  - but they were not convinced about eating it yet
  
- the next day, the fakir went to the patch again
  - the villagers showed up to see the fakir enjoying another watermelon
  - and some of them asked the fakir to share the watermelon
  - the fakir was happy to oblige
  - the villagers were delighted by the juicy fruit
  
- in the coming days, more villagers tried out the watermelons
  - and watermelons were accepted as an edible fruit in the village

#### moral of the story

- if the fakir had eaten the watermelon the first day, he would have been demonized 
- the villagers might have stoned him for eating something as horrific as the watermelon
  - because the villagers saw the watermelon as a demon

---

#### reflections

- in today's day an age, even if a fakir puts in the work to bring a watermelon into a village with patience and effort
  - it might still backfire 
  - and the fakir might be demonized for being materialistic
