# the nervous system 


### functions: 
- four basic functions of the central nervous system:
    - voluntary movement
    - perception
    - homeostasis
    - cognition 

#### voluntary movement

- driven by the brain; voluntary and involuntary expressions, such as:
    - facial expressions
    - raising your hand
    - jumping up and down
    - dance steps 

- is lost in people with locked-in syndrome for example

#### perception

- perception is what is consciously appreciated about sensation - not the same as sensation 
- sensory brain monitors CO<sub>2</sub> in the blood, organ chemical, muscle lengths etc., i.e. all the physical and chemical characteristics of the body 
    - but this is at a sub-system level 
    - [sense and receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_nervous_system#Senses_and_receptors){: target="_blank"}
    - the actual amounts don't reach the conscious perception 
- perception is vision and hearing, smell and taste, the sense of balance, the sense of position in the world 
    - "Where are we? Where is our head in the world? A sense of equilibrium"

#### homeostasis

- homeostasis is what we use to keep our body in physiological limits, which the body can tolerate
    - [homeostasis examples](https://examples.yourdictionary.com/homeostasis-examples.html){: target="_blank"}

- there are life cycle events that are challenges to our being
    - these include giving birth, and nursing a newborn, suckling from a mother - all of these things are part of homeostasis' effort to keep the body in equilibrium
    - another part of homeostasis is rhythm
        - daily rhythm: the wake and the sleep
        - seasonal rhythm: has a little bit less of an obvious influence
        - the cycle of life: we go from infancy, to childhood, to adolescence, early adulthood, to middle age, to being older
        
#### cognition

- these are abstract functions
    - thinking 
    - feeling emotions, and 
    - motivation
    - language, and 
    - memory, and 
    - learning
    - interaction with others

# neurons

- lung cells, liver cells, kidney cells, etc. might be of five, ten different types but after that - out of variation
- however, neurons are unique; they could be categorized into a million different types 
- they are the longest cells in the body 
    - the longest neuron starts at the big toe and ends at the back of the spinal cord; in really tall people, that one neuron can be 6 ft 

### parts of the neuron

- four parts:
    - cell body: 'soma' - the center of the cell body
    - dendrites: they receive information from synaptic terminals of other cells and relay it to the cell body
    - arbor: the tree of branching of dendrites, locally dense 
    - axon: relays messages out of the cell body, only one axon per neuron and can go far distances in the body

![Neuron Parts](/media/blogAssets/neurobiology/neuron-parts.svg)
{: style="text-align: center;"}

- synapse: communication center between neurons
    - space terminating one axon connecting to dendrite of next neuron
    - information travels out along the axon, ends up at the the synapse
    - at the synapse, the axon gives the information to the next dentrite in line; so synapse is the point of information transfer
    - a synapse can interface with:
        - other neurons 
        - muscles 
            - skeletal muscles, 
            - intestinal smooth muscles, 
            - cardiac muscles
        - glands (salivary gland)

- uniqueness: each neuron is very different form other cells and organs
    - in anatomy:
        - the dendritic arbor collects information from a volume
        - each neuron and it's arbor manifests a little differently 

    - in excitability:
        - how sensitive it is to actually fire
        - some keep firing all the time with little triggers, but some have to be pushed hard to trigger
        - comparable to sensor sensitivity in engineering, variability in speed of response

    - in neurotransmittance quality:
        - some only say "yes", others only say "no"
        - some "maybe", "probably", "questionably"
        - akin to [logic gates](https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/16-2-how-neurons-communicate/){: target="_blank"}


### glial cells 

- if neurons are like the stars of the show, glial cells are the support cast

- glia are needed for running the brain (the shit-show that it is), there are 10 times more glia than there are neurons; some other reach show there are slightly less number of them compared to neurons (research under progress)

- astrocytes: 
    - sanitation workers of the brain, cleaning up the refuse of the neurons including excess ions, excess non-transmitters and their metabolites

    - allow neurons to reach the location from where they are born while they develop as an earlier stage progenitor cell, hence are vehicles for neuron transmitters 

    - synapses are enveloped in the processes of astrocytes and are supported by glia in their maintenance
    - 20% of glia cells
        - oligodendrocytes and schwann cells make myelin
            - oligodendrocytes:
                - make myelin in the central nervous system (CNS) 
                - 75% of central glia cells 
            - schwann cells:
                - make it in the peripheral nervous system (PNS)

- microglia are the exception to that rule that cells of the nervous system come from the ectoderm (in the embryo), but these come from the blood 
    - they are immune cells which quietly monitor for problems

    - when there is a problem, they try to rectify things and bring some attention to areas of damage

    - sometimes they go overboard and they start to participate in making the problem as well as solving the problem (hot topic)


### myelin

- neurons can be myelinated or un-myelinated; myelin is a fatty wrap on some axons, 

- parallel stretchs of myelin sheaths made of layers and layers of myelin cover the axon body; there are gaps between adjacent myelin wraps for the signal to jump over as they travel down the axon

- information speeds are different along the two types of axons:
    - un-myelinated:  0.2 - 1 m/s (1.5m in 1.5s to 7s)
    - myelinated: 2 - 120 m/s (1.5m in 0.012s - 0.75s)

- [action potential spike transfer along an axon - myelinated vs. un-myelinated](https://youtu.be/DJe3_3XsBOg){: target="_blank"}

- axon information is transferred as binary code (0s and 1s), the 1s in the code are the activation potential spike
    - the temporal pattern (timing) of these spikes carries the information
    - (electric) signal jumps across the myelin wraps like hoops to increase speed
    - absence on myelin doesn't allow jumps of signals and hence slows it down 

- if the myelin sheaths are damaged, they disrupt the patterning of action potential and some activation potentials never reach the end of the axon
    - diseases from demyelination/ myelinating glial cells
        - CNS: 
            - multiple sclerosis/oligodendrocytes
            - symptoms affects motor functions
        - PNS: 
            - charcot-marie-tooth/schwann cells
            - guillian-barre/schwann cells
            - symptoms affect either sensation, control of skeletal muscles, and internal organs

# central nervous system (CNS) vs. peripheral nervous system (PNS)

- there is a demarcation between the central and the peripheral system called *meninges*
- neurons are classified to belong to either based on where their cell body is 



- all the neurons of the CNS are contained within the meninges

- only motors neurons go out through meninges:
    - to go into the PNS, and rest of the body to control motor function
    - the outgoing motor neurons also connect to **autonomic neurons** that control glands, cardiac muscles, smooth muscles and guts 

- sensory neuron are located peripherally and carry information into the CNS

### meninges

- the meninges is made of three membranes
    - the pia: weak and tender film
        - closest to the brain
    - the arachnoid: spidery webbed layer 
        - between the pia and the dura
    - the dura: tough layer
        - protects from having concussions all the time and floats brain in a fluid, takes hard hits

![Meninges](/media/blogAssets/neurobiology/meninges.svg)
{: style="text-align: center;"}

- the meninges protects the central nerves from the diseases of the periphery nerves 
    - the neurons in the periphery like the sensory neurons and the autonomic neurons in the autonomic ganglia are vulnerable to the diseases that don't affect the CNS eg. congenital insensitivity to pain
    - the meninges forms barrier against toxins, viruses, and damage

### peripherals 

- diseases that affect the nervous system affect either the CNS or PNS, they tend to not affect both at the same time
    - PNS is far more vulnerable than the CNS

- repairing capabilities of central and periphery differ 
    - cut periphery neurons repair themselves if cut
    - trauma to the central neurons does not heal

- although the periphery system is more vulnerable, their neurons have a far greater capacity to repair; damage to central neurons doesn't happen 
    - atomic area of research to find healing environments for CNS

- polio virus enters the synapse of an axon that connects with a motor muscle and enters the CNS through the meninges piggy-backing on that axon
    - the host motor neuron will die when the virus enters the its cell body in the CNS
    - control for the muscle that the virus entered through will be weak or lost as the virus kills the associated motor neuron 

- botulinum toxin affects only the PNS

- herpes zoster causes shingles, where the virus enters the synapse of an axon of the sensory neuron on the skin
    - the virus travels up the axon and lives in an appendage cavity on the axon and may stay harmless unless it decides to blossom
    - if it does reproduce (an outbreak), it sends back the virus on the axon to the skin, causing a rash
    - affects only one side of body
    - this disease goes away

### brain tumors 

- a cell in some part of the body loses it and keeps dividing without limits, becoming immortal 
    - this causes a tumor, this can be removed 

- but sometimes, the cells from those tumor go rouge and travel to other parts of the body (they metastasize)
    - so once source if brain tumors is it can be a rouge tumor cell  from other tumors in the body
    - as the tumor expands in the cranium, it can pressurize the insides and cause problems

- once a neuron is born, it grows and it dies - it does not replace itself
    - neurons don't make tumors because they don't divide at all and doesn't cause uncontrolled divisions

- glia cells can be another the source of brain tumors as they divide uncontrollably sometimes; their tumors are called gliomas
    - myelin producing glial cells surrounding the cranial nerves can grow tumors, producing dysfunction of facial expression, balance and sensory function

- meningial cell division can cause tumors called meningiomas, and they cause pressure within the cranium leading to problems

- glandular cells of pineal gland and pituitary gland might divide to cause tumors
    - pineal gland produces melatonin which influences sexual development and daily sleep-wake cycles
    - pituitary gland is often called the master gland because it controls several other hormone glands in your body, including the thyroid and adrenals, the ovaries and testicles
        - pituitary agnomas are tumors erupting from this gland

<hr>

# brain and spinal cord

- brain and spinal cord are the two main units of the nervous system along with the nerves 
    - the brain is in the cranium
    - the spinal cord is contained in the nervous system 

- foramen magnum is the hole at the bottom of the cranium that lets the top of the spinal cord connect to the bottom of the brain

- the dura mater of the meninges wraps the brain and the entirety of the spinal cord
    - it is separated from the brain by a layer of fluid, encasing it in a bag of fluid, providing it cushioning
    - the dura and inside of the skull are plastered, with blood vessels in-between
    - however, the dura is not plastered up against the insides of the vertebra
        - the spinal cord can move a bit within the vertebra
    - so pressure buildup within the brain due to tumors is more riskier than pressure buildup within the spinal cord

    - there are fold within the dura to add strength

- the arachnoid wraps the brain bulk but doesn't cover the hills and valleys 

- the pia mater covers the hills and valleys of the outer surface of the cerebrum

# relevant terms 

- "somatic" mutation: present in only some parts of the body
- "germline” mutation: is present in all cells of body
