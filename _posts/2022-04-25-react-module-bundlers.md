# Bundlers: 

- bundlers optmize files for delivery over the network
- examples:
  - parcel: zero configuration
  - webpack: highly configurable
  - rollup.js: good for tree-shaking (removed used code before bundling)  

- things are always evolving: so some specific construct that applied 2 years ago might not apply now

## webpack

- used in Create React App (APP)
- 'bundles' JS modules and dependencies into static assets 

- webpack setup and configuration is very instense and also prone to change!

## babel

- transpiles ES6 and ES7 etc to ES5 JS to maintain browser compatibility

# resources

- [Frontend build config generator](https://createapp.dev/webpack/react--babel--react-hot-loader)
