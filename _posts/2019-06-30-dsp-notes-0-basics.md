## digital signal processing 

- signal: description of a physical phenomenon's evolution over time

- signal processing:
    - analysis: understanding the information carried by the signal
    - synthesis: creating a signal to contain the information 

- digital paradigm for signal processing:
    - discrete, digitized time
    - discrete, digitized amplitude

- a digital signal is a sequence of observations called *samples*
    - a *sample* is denoted by \\( x[n] \\)

- each *sample* is subjected to both:
    - time discretization: time component '\\(n\\)'
    - amplitude discretization: amplitude component '\\(x\\)'


#### discrete-time

- discrete-time model: 
    - a paradigm that moves away from the idealistic analog view
        - makes computation more intuitive 
        - finding solutions easier with computational methods
    - more practical model of reality compared to analog models

- Sampling Theorem:
    - mathematically, analog and discrete models are equivalent
        - provided sufficient discrete sampling is available 

- samples replace idealized models
- simple math replaces calculus


#### discrete-amplitude

- each amplitude can only take on a value from a predetermined set
    - the number of levels in countable
    - so the amplitude is mapped to a set of integers

- this ability to integer mapping provides benefits for
    - storage
    - processing
    - transmission

- analog signals suffer from noise and attenuation in way that causes loss of information during signal transmission
    - digital signal transmission mechanisms are more robust 
    - information is significantly low

- general-purpose storage can be used
- general-purpose processing can be applied
- noise can be controlled during signal transmission

## discrete-time signals

- 'lollipop' notation
- discrete-time signals sampled sufficiently densely look continuous in a plot

#### formally

- a sequence of complex numbers
- one dimensional
- notation: \\( x[n] \\)
    - \\( [n] \\): integer
- two-sided sequences: \\( x: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{C} \\) 
    - \\( n \in (-\infty,+\infty)   \\) 
- \\(n\\) is *adimensional* "time"
    - no physical units, just a counter
    - can embody periodicity
        - number of samples of the repeating pattern 

- analysis eg.: periodic temperature, sea-level, river water level
- synthesis eg.: stream of algorithm generated samples

#### fundamental discrete signals

- delta signal: \\( x[n] = ùõø[n] \\)  
    - when \\(n = 0 , x = 1 \\); else \\(x = 0\\)
    - signifies a physical phenomenon that lasts a very short duration of time
    - eg. a clapper for syncing video and audio for a movie recording 
        - when audio and video recording happens separately

{: style="font-size: 80%; text-align: center;"}

- unit step: \\( x[n] = u[n] \\)
    - when \\( n < 0, x = 0 \\); else \\(x = 1 \\)
    - synonymous to flipping a switch

*fig: discrete unit step*
{: style="font-size: 80%; text-align: center;"}

- exponential decay: \\( x[n] = \lvert a\rvert^n u[n], \lvert a\rvert < 1 \\)
    - when \\( n < 0, x = 0 \\); else \\(x\\) decays exponentially, starting from \\( 1 \\) @ \\( n = 0 \\)
    - \\( x \rightarrow 0 \\) as \\( n \rightarrow \infty \\)
    - newton's law of cooling
        - cooling of a coffee cup
    - rate of capacitor discharge

{: style="font-size: 80%; text-align: center;"}
    
- sinusoid: \\( x[n] = sin(\omega_0n + \theta) \\)
    - \\( \omega_0 \\): angular frequency (rad)
    - \\( \theta \\): initial phase (rad)

## signal classes

- finite-length
- infinite length
- periodic 
- finite-support

#### finite-length signals

- can only have \\(N\\) samples 
    - \\(N\\): range of signal
    - \\(N\\) is limited in finite-length signals
- notations: 
    - sequence: \\(x[n], n = 0,1,\ldots,N-1\\)
    - vector: \\(x = [x_0, x_1,\ldots, x_{N-1} ]^T \\)
- practical entities
    - good for numerical packages 

#### infinite-length signals

- can have infinite number of samples
- it is an abstraction
- useful for theorems that do not depend on the length of the data

#### periodic signals

- repetitive samples with a constant frequency 

- notation: \\(\tilde{x}\\) (x-tilde)
- \\(N\\)-periodic signals: \\( x[n] = \tilde{x}[n + kN]; n, k, N \in \mathbb{Z} \\)
    - data repeats every \\(N\\) samples
    - same information as finite-length of length \\(N\\)
    - natural bridge between finite and infinite lengths

#### finite-support signals

- infinite length sequence
    - but only a finite number of non-zero sample

- notation: \\(\bar{x}\\) (x-bar)
- \\( \bar{x}  = x[n] \\) if \\(0 \leq n \leq N \\) else \\( x = 0 ; n \in \mathbb{Z} \\)
- same information as finite-length 
- another bridge between finite and infinite length lengths

## elementary signal operations

- scaling:
    - \\( y[n] = \alpha\cdot x[n] \\)
- sum:
    - \\( y[n] = x[n] + z[n] \\)
- product:
    - \\( y[n] = x[n]\cdot z[n] \\)
- delay (shift):
    - \\( y[n] = x[n-k], x \in \mathbb{Z} \\)
    - output of operation is shifted by \\(k\\) samples
    - care must be taken to append and prepend zeros to accommodate the shift 

    - two types of delay:
        - finite-length is turned into finite-support 
            - by adding zeros until \\( -\infty \\) and \\( +\infty \\) 
            - then shift is applied
        - make the finite-signal periodic:  
            - samples circle around in the given range of \\(N\\)

- energy:
    - sum of the squares of all amplitudes of the signal 
    - consistent with physical energy 
    - many signals have infinite energy i.e. periodic signals
    - so not a great way to describe the energetic property of a signal 


\\[ E_x = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \lvert x[n] \rvert^2 \\]

- power: 
    - a signal cannot have infinite power even if it's energy is infinite
    - power is the rate of production of energy for a sequence
    - it is limit of the ratio of local energy in a window to the size of the window as N goes to infinity
    - for a periodic signal, the power is the ratio fo energy in one period to the length of the period

\\[ P_x = \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{2N+1} \sum_{n=-N}^{N} \lvert x[n] \rvert^2 \\]

## simple dsp applications

#### digital vs. physical frequency

- discrete time:
    - \\(n\\): just a counter, no time dimension
    - periodicity: number of samples of one cycle of the pattern

- physical time:
    - frequency: \\( \text{Hz } (s^{-1})\\)
    - periodicity: number of seconds of one cycle of the pattern

#### dsp lab: laptop/desktop 

- a desktop computer is a signal processing lab for all practical purposes
- signals can be generated 
    - visualed as plots  
    - can be used to generate sounds
        - an analog-digital interface is needed for this

- a sound card is an interface that converts digital signals to analog
    - has a system clock of period \\( T_s \\) seconds
    - discrete samples at \\( T_s \\) intervals are sampled and converted to analog electrical signals

- a periodicity of \\( M \\) samples in digital domain
    - becomes \\( MT_s \text{ }\\) seconds in the physical domain
    - frequency in physical domain \\( f = \frac{1}{MT_s} \text{Hz}\\)

- sampling rate for sound card: \\(F_s\\)
    - \\( T_s = \frac{1}{F_s}\\)
    - usually \\(F_s = 48000 \text{ Hz} \\); so \\(T_s \approx 20.8\mu s \\)
    - so, for \\(M = 110 \text{, } f \approx 440 \text{Hz}\\)
    - and \\( M = \frac{F_s}{f} \\)

- dsp involves a few fundamental building blocks
    - adder block:
        - \\(x[n] + y[n]\\)

            <img class="plot mx-auto text-center img-fluid" src="/media/blogAssets/dsp/adder_block.png" alt="adder block">

            *fig: adder block*
            {: style="font-size: 80%; text-align: center;"}

    - scaler block:
        - \\( \alpha\cdot x[n] \\)

            <img class="plot mx-auto text-center img-fluid" src="/media/blogAssets/dsp/scaler_block.png" alt="scaler block">

            *fig: scaler block*
            {: style="font-size: 80%; text-align: center;"}

    - delay block:
        - \\( x[n] \rightarrow z^{-1} \rightarrow x[n-1]\\)
            - \\( (z^{-1})\\) means unit buffer 
            - holds current value and send previously held value

            <img class="plot mx-auto text-center img-fluid" src="/media/blogAssets/dsp/unit_delay_block.png" alt="unit delay block">

            *fig: unit delay (buffer) block*
            {: style="font-size: 80%; text-align: center;"}

        
        - \\( x[n] \rightarrow z^{-N} \rightarrow x[n-N]\\)
            - \\( (z^{-N})\\) means \\(N\\) samples buffer 

            <img class="plot mx-auto text-center img-fluid" src="/media/blogAssets/dsp/n_delay_block.png" alt="n delay block">

            *fig: N delay (buffer) block*
            {: style="font-size: 80%; text-align: center;"}

- these blocks can be combined in any way to build arbitrarily complex circuitry for analysis or synthesis
    - an abstract implementation of dsp algorithm is first made  
        - with the building blocks in a flow chart 
        - can then be coded and executed in any language

    - example: moving average:
        - local average of a few samples
        - 2-sample moving average:
            - \\(y[n] = \frac{x[n] \text{ }+\text{ } x[n-1]}{2}\\)

            <img class="plot mx-auto text-center img-fluid" src="/media/blogAssets/dsp/two_pt_mov_avg.png" alt="two-pt mov avg">

            *fig: two-point moving average block*
            {: style="font-size: 80%; text-align: center;"}
        - M sample moving average is an ubiquitous tool to smooth discrete signals

- feedback loop:
    - unit delay feedback loop
        - \\( y[n] = x[n] + \alpha x[n-1] \\) 

        <img class="plot mx-auto text-center img-fluid" src="/media/blogAssets/dsp/feedback_loop_block.png" alt="feedback loop">

        *fig: feedback loop with delay*
        {: style="font-size: 80%; text-align: center;"}

    - introduces recursion in the algorithm: chicken-and-egg problem
    - to solve the particular problem feedback loop is applied to
        - set a start time \\(n_0\\)
        - assert zero initial conditions for input and output for all time before \\(n_0\\)
        
    - feedback loop for interest accumulation in a bank account:
        - assume interest rate 10% p.a. 
        - interest accrual date: Dec 31
        - deposit/withdrawals in year \\(n\\): \\(x[n]\\)
        - so balance (with accrued interest) at year-end is:
            - \\( y[n] = 1.1y[n-1]\text{ }+\text{ }x[n]\\)

    - M-delay feedback loop:
        - \\( y[n] = x[n] + \alpha x[n-M] \\) 

        <img class="plot mx-auto text-center img-fluid" src="/media/blogAssets/dsp/m_fb_loop_block.png" alt="m delay feedback loop">

        *fig: M-samples delay feedback loop*
        {: style="font-size: 80%; text-align: center;"}

        - equivalent to cascading unit delays in feedback branch

- Karplus-Strong Algorithm:
    - to synthesize plucked-string sound
    - algorithm: build a recursion loop with a delay \\(M\\)
        - \\( y[n] = x[n] + \alpha x[n-M] \\) 
        - the number of samples controls the pitch of the output sound
    - input: finite support signal \\( \bar{x}[n]\\)
        - non-zero only for \\( 0 \leq n < M \\)
        - this controls the timbre of the output 
    - parameters to configure (knobs of the algorithm):   
        - decay factor: \\( \alpha \\)
            - \\( \alpha = 1\\): no decay (100% feedback)
            - \\( \alpha = 0\\): extreme decay (0% feedback)
        - controls how sustained the sound is 
    - run the algorithm on the input to generate output

    - a random valued (\\([-1,1]\\)) finite-support signal input was found to give best results 

- Refactoring DSP operations:
    - DSP operations can get complex very quickly 
    - refactoring them is an art that heavily aids building simple block diagrams 
    - the simplified expressions are used for efficiency in analysis and synthesis
