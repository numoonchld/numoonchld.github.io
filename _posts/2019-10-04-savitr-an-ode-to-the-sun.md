## Selflessness, Photosynthesis and Solar Energy

- "... sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming, The moon's gonna owe it one ..." 
    - Linkin Park [(A Place For My Head)](http://www.metrolyrics.com/a-place-for-my-head-lyrics-linkin-park.html){: target = "_blank"}

- Taking a leaf from the plants' books: photosynthesis for life sustenance
- Solar energy is the future of electricity and electricity is the power to drive this planet

- Powers a new God:
    - Electricity is a God of the now and the future
    - Sand (silica) converts the Solar energy to Electricity
    

## Sunrises and Sunsets

- Transitions 
    - from the dark of the night into the day 
        - start of a something 
        - marks the beginning point of a steady (day-to-day) cycle
    - from the light of the day into the night 
        - end of something 
        - marks the end of cycle in a steady cycle

- Beauty and Glory
    - sunrises and sunsets are glorious 
    - the break of dawn symbolizes hopes, ambition and drive
    - sunsets mark the beautiful and contented completion of the hustle and bustle of the day

### Track-list and Notes


#### खग (Khaga)

- The sun as a bird, that flies in the sky (who moves in the sky)
- watches all and everything, everything that happens in the day happens in under light of the sun
- keeper of time as it makes it's journey across the sky (see circadian rhythm)
- eats away pathogens (in water)
  - SODIS

#### पूषण् (Pūşhan)

- light that helps through transitions
- guiding hand that helps find value in life 
- journey guide that protects from evil 

#### मित्र​-​वरुण (Mitra​-​Varuṇa)

- Dvanda: 
    - Mitra-Varuna are seen as composite of Mitra and Varuna

- Mitra: the sun as a friend to all, 
    - doesn't prioritize providing light and heat to the variety of organisms that exist on planet Earth (and beyond?)
    - sustains life by providing the drive for mankind to work (see circadian rhythm)
    
- Varuna: water and ocean, 
    - "we all come from water and go back to water"
    - the source of organisms on this planet
    - the majority of the human body is water
    - There is life in water due to inherent polarity on water: H+ and OH- ions
    - Life is polar: opposites exist, sometimes in conflict, other times in harmony and everywhere in between 

- Mitra and Varuna together provide drive and sustenance to the variety of organisms on planet Earth 


#### सवितृ (Savitṛ)

- a stimulator for life energy on earth 
- driver of the animation of life
- plants, circadian rhythms, water cycles, wind cycles
- gravity and light

#### अरुण (Aruṇa)

- copper-red sun rays of dawn
- the precursor to the golden hour of the morning
- light that begins the day, initiating the rest of the manifestations of the sun throughout the day
- the "charioteer" of the sun
