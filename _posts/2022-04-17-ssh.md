# intro

**protocol examples**:
- HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
- FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
- HTTPS (HTTP Secure - i.e. encrypted)
- SSH (Secure Shell Protocol)
- IMAP (Emails)

### **SSH**: Secure Shell Protocol
  - a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network
  - most notable applications are remote login and remote command-line execution

- *host*: remote server we are trying to connect to using SSH
- *client*: computer used to access the host

#### CLI command for `ssh` connections

- `ssh {user}@{host}` (linux & mac)
  - example: `ssh root@167.99.146.50` 
    - `167.99.146.50`: host address, can be IP addresses and domain names
    - `root`: user account within the host computer


- in windows, utilize SSH client called `PuTTy`

# SSH under-the-hood:

- encryption is to hide something by jumbling it up, needs to be decrypted to get back hidden information

- SSH under the hood has three parts:
  - *symmetrical encryption*
    - uses one secret key for both encryption and decryption
    - SSH uses a shared key
      - generated prior to client authentication 
      - is specfic to that SSH session
      - key exchange algorithm steps into share the key the client and the host
     
    
  - *asymmetrical encryption* 
    - uses separate keys for encryption and decryption
    - public-private key pairs (Public-key cryptography)
      - private key cannot be used to compute public key 
      - private keys are used to encrypt, not to be shared with anyone as this relies on the private key being a secret for providing encrpytion

       
  - *hashing*
    - the client may be impersonated to the server by providng the right keys
    - all data will be recevied by the impersonater if keys are compromised
    - this warrants for hashing, which is cryptography used in SSH
       - `BCrypt` is a popular hashing package in npm
    - if 3rd party dupes client or host
      - hashes verify the authenticity of the data 
    - **HMAC** is a popular hashing function


### notes

- asymmetric encryption is time consuming and hence most SSH connections use symmetric encryption
  - asymmetric encrytpion is only used to share a secret key, after which the secret key is used for the SSH communication
- asymmetric cryptography is used to verify the identity of the SSH server, and then symmetric key encryption and hashing algorithms are used to maintain data transmission in ciphertext
