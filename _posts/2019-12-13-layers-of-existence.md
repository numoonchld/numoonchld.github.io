- five layered (pancha-kosha) human existence 
    1. annamaya kosha (matter layer)
    2. praanamaya kosha 
    3. manomaya kosha
    4. vijnaanamaya kosha
    5. aanandamaya kosha

- 'kosha'
    - literally means 'container' 
    - also may be read as 'layer' in this context

---

## 1/ annamaya kosha

- this is the *pancha bhoota* layer
- the pancha bhootas are 
    - prithvi (earth/solids)
    - jala/aapa (water/liquids)
    - agni (fire)
    - vaayu (air/wind)
    - aakaasha (sky/outer space)

- these spirits in the human body are nourished by the food consumed

#### translation and interpretation

- 'anna'
    - literally means 'food' or 'rice grains'
    - in this context, more aptly, 'matter'
- 'maya'
    - literally means 'full of' or 'made of'
    - not to be confused with 'maaya', which stands for illusion
- 'annamaya kosha'
    - literally means 'container full of food'
    - matter based aspect of a human's physical personality 

- 'pancha'
    - (of) five (kinds)

- 'bhoota' 
    - literally 'spirit' 
    - also may be read as the 'underlying concept' in this context

#### about

- everything in the universe is made up of matter or 'anna'
    - common principle of external universe 


- this layer is the primary matter layer of existence
    - the grossest of the five koshas
- concepts that are bound by energy laws reside within 
- the layer of materialist's validation

    
#### function

- forms the physical framework for the pancha-koshas     
- layer of physical reality where the fruit of all processes from higher layers manifest
- everything in the universe 
    - comes of out matter, 
    - is sustained by matter, and 
    - dissolved back into matter

- atoms conglomerate to form various chemicals 
    - atoms > molecules > cells > tissues > organs > organism

- atoms form hormones on human body via various permutations and combinations
- responsible for flow of electricity

## 2/ praanamaya

- praana literally means 'life force'
- this is the layer of the *pancha praana* 
    - i.e. 5 (five) life forces
- the 5 life forces are 
    - apaana (downward exertion)
    - praana (cyclic breathing forces)
    - udaana (upward forces)
    - samaana (balancing praana and apaana)
    - vyaana (periphery balance)

- these five praanas are the dimensions of a main praana called
    - mukhya praana
- this mukhya praana flows through the nadi system
    - which are subtle channels in the human body

#### translation and interpretation

- 'praana' literally means 'life'

#### meaning

- praana is the basic fabric layer built around the annamaya kosha's matter framework
    - both inside and outside the human body

- a balance between the five dimensions of mukhya praana is good health
    - and an imbalance is ill health and sickness


#### function

- the annamaya kosha comes out of the praanamaya kosha in the human being
    - can increase or decrease itself without any external agency

- without praana, a human body is just gross matter
    - it is said to be lifeless

- a harmonious flow of praana to each and every cell of the body's annamaya kosha keeps them healthy 
    - mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell

- praana flows on demand to different parts of the body, based on current activity 
    - i.e. swimming vs. studying 
    - different amount of praana are needed by different parts of the body during these activities 

- apaana is for downward activities like 
    - passing stool
    - urination
    - menstruation
    - ejaculation
    - parturition (child birth)
- praana is for cyclical activities like 
    - breathing
- udaana is for upward activities like
    - vomiting 
- samaana is for digestion 
- vyaana is for peripheral activities like 
    - nerve impulses 
    - blood circulation
    - cellular activity
