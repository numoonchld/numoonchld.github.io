- a woman in a village had a baby 
  - she also had a pet mongoose 
  
- she went out to fetch a pail of water 
  - from a river nearby
  - she left the mongoose with the baby

- when she returned, she saw the mongoose covered with blood 
  - she assumed that the mongoose had eaten her baby
  - and she killed it
  
- then she rushed in and found the baby to be fine 
  - and found a dead snake next to her baby 
  - she was filled with regret for having killed a great companion
