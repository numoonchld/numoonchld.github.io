- several performance pinch points exist in web application systems
- optimizations for such performance pinch points are of three categories
  1. network transfer
  2. frontend 
  3. backend  


## techniques for optimization

- network transfer optimization 
  - minimize files
  - minimize delivery

- frontend optimization 
  - critical render path
  - optimized code
  - progressive web app

- backend optimization 
  - CDNs
  - caching
  - load balancing
  - DB Scaling
  - GZIP
